# Custom Task Manager

Plan your tasks, organize your teamwork and create invoices for the jobs without leaving Airtable.

>This Airtable base is utilizing Airtable's Interfaces and Automations and was designed basing on the successful usage experience in several projects and companies.

In addition to the standard task-managing functions (like calendar, timeline, tasks, projects, task statuses and assignees) the Custom Task Manager included some extra functionality, such as:
- **Email notifications**
- **Invoice creation**
- **Time-tracking**

>Due to active usage of Automations, the base will work better on Airtable plans Plus, Pro and higher. Consider disabling Automations on the Free plan due to a low automation run limit.
