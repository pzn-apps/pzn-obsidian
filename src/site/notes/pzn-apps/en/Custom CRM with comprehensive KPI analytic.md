# Custom CRM with comprehensive KPI analytics for an HVAC business

A custom CRM that consolidates multi-source lead capture, delivers flexible KPI tracking, and provides role-specific dashboards for detailed deal oversight, performance evaluation, and strategic sales insights — all at a lower cost than off-the-shelf platforms.

### Tech-stack

Airtable, Hubspot CRM, WordPress API, Gravity Forms

## Pain points

The client relied on HubSpot for lead and sales management, but the licensing cost for the entire team was too high. HubSpot’s KPI system lacked flexibility, and its customization options could not adapt to the client’s specific operational needs.

Lead intake was fragmented across several channels — web forms, manual entry, and a legacy CRM — with no centralized database. The lack of a tailored dashboard and granular filtering slowed down the tracking of deal stages, rep performance, and overall funnel health.

## Objectives

- Reduce CRM costs while retaining core and advanced lead management features
- Centralize lead intake from multiple sources:
    - Manual entry via internal form
    - Integration with Gravity Forms on the client’s WordPress site
    - Import from legacy CRM data
- Implement customizable KPIs to reflect the client’s real business metrics
- Provide role-based dashboards for sales reps and admins
- Enable quick search, filtering, and grouping by lead stage, rep, or source
- Automate address completion via postal code lookup
- Offer detailed visibility into:
    - Individual deals and requests
    - Employee performance statistics
    - Company-wide trends and sales funnel insights
