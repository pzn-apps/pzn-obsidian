# Edit field's data path

To edit a field's path, select the field in drop-down list and click Edit to the right of the dropdown, or simply click üñäÔ∏è icon next to the field name in the list.

Data path is a sequence of fields pointing to a specific location in the base where the required data is stored. If selected field is a **Link To Another Table**, you'll be prompted to selected a field in the linked table and so on.

### Filtering
**Filter** switch in the data path allows you to filter the linked records. 
For example, there are several counterparts linked to a contract: using the filter you can specify which of the counterparts should be used by the extension.
When the **Filter** switch is activated, a filter element is inserted into the data path with the following options available:
- ***Use the 1st element only***
- ***When \<some field\> = \<some value\>***: if you choose a field from dropdown list and specify a value, the extension will use only the linked records that match this condition
- ***When \<some field\> is not empty***: if you choose a field from dropdown list and leave the value input empty, the extension will use only the linked records where the specified filled isn't empty
If the **Filter** switch is off, all the linked records will be used by the extension
